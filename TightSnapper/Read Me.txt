Todo:
1.) Directly take snapshots of the VNC Server session, rather than taking snapshots of a window on a local VNC Viewer session.
2.) Allow for multiple viewers with different file output naming conventions for each client.
4.) Change PrintWindow method to allow for capturing of a session while the viewer is minimized.
